# Slow Pitch League App

What I'm trying to build is a way for the league to better manage games, team stats, messages, etc.

## Routing

[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) will be used for the client-side. I'll continue reading more about it and implementing more over the upcoming weeks.

## UI Library

[Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) will be used for the component library. I'll continue reading more about it and implementing more over the upcoming weeks.
